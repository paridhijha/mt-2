honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to meeting of this committee . 
and I expected the committee admits knew that it does what too senators make independent . 
what will not concern for the time so . 
the members of the selection committee can show some impact . 
on the business that a senator reshape over the next two years . 
it is a committee , important because , in principle , these nine determine senators to committee what some senators sit . 
therefore my introduced in the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the nine not attend senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators name , I do person . 
you can see how now to friendly i am , ' t it ? 
the senators will have their own research who was on to find fault . 
when an individual work accepts an the , it must do . 
the women who sit in the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the veterans of the in February 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or the House of Commons do sitting at the time . 
three senators saw Liberals to proceedings , all of the committee of women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite word by word , what , senator Carstairs took the hon. responded to the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it has said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that it had on the drafted parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
delegations Les were at the time only formées of men . 
on this matter , this is I was replaced by the senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I look still re - enter the opportunity to my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how when the House or a decision will about these two reports . 
every time that the senators are verdict on television . 
wondered or by a group of students , to journalists or other . 
say that we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , it should be in fact bring . 
i do not think the to replacing . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or it should participate in all the meetings intended . 
we are not the which members the words in the corridors : 
" Présentez to committee do you today , and after two years of education , there is a final vote in committee '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed , but they came to sang when their leaders sang to them . 
they do not know absolutely what has happened not . 
honourable senators , the words " continuité " and " dedication are '' in the way in our speech . 
in the next two weeks , beginning to reflect on the way we will address the situation of the independent senators . 
if we do are not the créerai , I my own committee of parliamentarians who are concerned about the world affairs . 
we are no one can gained . 
his Honour the Speaker : 
if any other hon. senator wishes to speak , do you , is it the pleasure honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
